case 1: empty at the start
	check! I think...
case 2: after first operation (a+b=__), input a number...
(expected: clear everything and display new input)
	check! I think...	
case 3: in the middle of long series meaning first operand is already defined
	check! I think...
case 4: press equals with incomplete operation
(expected: delayed CLR, set overwrite to 1)
	check! I think...
case 5: repeat operator
(expected: if no first operand, do nothing... else, overwrite)
	check! I think...
case 6: empty at the start but start with operator
(expected: do nothing)
	check! I think...
case 7: press numbers then equal sign
(expected: delayed CLR, set overwrite to 1)
