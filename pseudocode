when typing numbers, if overwrite, CLEAR first then set overwrite to zero,
^populate the screen afterwards

when an operator is clicked, do the following:
if operator is not undefind or screen is empty
	if operand1 is undefined
		do nothing...
	else (operand1 is defined)
		if operator is =
			clear everything
		else
			overwrite the operator
			set overwrite to 1(clear the screen)
else if first operand is undefined
	if (operator is =)
		clear everything (variables and screen)
	else
		store value of operator
		take the screen text content and store it as the first operand.
	set overwrite to 1(clear the screen)
else
	take the screen text content and store it as the second operand.
	operate on the three variables
	display result, set overwrite to 1, clear second operand and operator
	if operator is +,-,*,/
		result is copied to the first operand
		store new operator
	else (operator is =)
		first operand is cleared


store second operand, and operate, display result, clear second operand and 
operator, store new operator and copy result to first operand if not equals,
else clear operator and first operand
